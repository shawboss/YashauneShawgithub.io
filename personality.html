        <br>
        <p> I'm thrilled to share with you my favorite sports icon, Bruno Fernandes,
            a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Manchester United and the Portugal national team.</p>
        
        <p> One of my favorite quotes from Bruno Fernandes is: <blockquote>"I don't want to be a player who just plays. I want to be a player who makes a difference."- Bruno Fernandes </blockquote> 
            This quote resonates with me because it highlights his commitment to making a positive impact on the game and inspiring others to do the same.</p>

        <h3>Personality Test Result</h3>
        <img src="../Assets/Personality Test Results.png" alt="Personality Test Results">
        <br>
        <p>The personality test results in the image indicate that I am predominantly introverted (79%), which suggests that I tend to prefer more meaningful social interactions and am drawn to quieter environments. 
           Additionally, I scored 58% observant, implying that I focus more on concrete facts rather than abstract possibilities. My thinking style, with a 58% score, reflects a tendency to make decisions based on logic rather than emotions. 
           The judging trait (75%) shows that I prefer structure and planning over spontaneity, while the 53% assertive score suggests a balanced self-assurance in decision-making and handling stress.</p>
        <p>General Validity:
            Personality tests like this often provide generalized insights based on patterns of behavior, which can be useful for self-reflection. 
            In general, I believe such tests have some validity because they are based on psychological theories and can reveal consistent traits across different individuals. 
            However, they can be oversimplified and may not capture the full complexity of personality, as people might behave differently depending on the situation or environment.
        </p>
        <p>Personal Reflection:
            In my case, the test results align with how I perceive myself. I agree with the introversion and judging traits, as I tend to prefer a structured approach and more intimate social interactions. 
            The mix of thinking and observant traits also fits my tendency to analyze situations logically and focus on the practical aspects of problems. 
            That said, some traits like assertiveness may fluctuate based on circumstances, making the test results more of a snapshot than a fixed representation of who I am.
