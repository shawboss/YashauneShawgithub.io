        <h2>Reflection on Twelve Pillars</h2>
        <h3>Summary of Chapters 4–7 of Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener:</h3>
        <br> 
        <p> Chapter 4: "Achieve Your Goals"
            In this chapter, Mr. Davis emphasizes the importance of setting and achieving clear goals. 
            He explains to Michael that success in life doesn't happen by accident but through purposeful planning and action. 
            Mr. Davis introduces the idea that goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). 
            Without goals, people drift aimlessly, but with well-defined goals, one can maintain direction and purpose. 
            Achieving goals requires commitment, regular evaluation, and breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. 
            Mr. Davis also stresses the need for flexibility; while the destination remains the same, the path can change.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>Chapter 5: "The Proper Use of Time"
           This chapter focuses on time management. Mr. Davis teaches Michael that time is a limited resource, and using it wisely is essential to success. 
           He encourages Michael to identify the most important tasks and prioritize them. 
           By minimizing distractions and focusing on what matters most, one can maximize productivity. 
           Time management also involves finding a balance between work and personal life to avoid burnout.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>Chapter 6: "Surround Yourself with the Best People"
            Mr. Davis explains that success is influenced by the people you spend time with. 
            Associating with positive, motivated, and successful individuals will elevate your own standards and mindset. 
            Conversely, being around negative or unambitious people can drag you down. 
            Michael learns that surrounding himself with the right people will inspire him to strive for excellence.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>Chapter 7: "Be a Lifelong Learner"
           This chapter focuses on the importance of continuous learning. 
           Mr. Davis tells Michael that learning doesn’t stop with formal education; it’s a lifelong process. 
           Successful people constantly seek to improve their knowledge and skills, whether through reading, attending seminars, or learning from mentors.
           By committing to lifelong learning, one remains adaptable and competitive in an ever-changing world.

        <h3>Reflection On How This Book can Apply To life</h3>
        <p>Reading these chapters made me realize how I can apply these lessons to my life:
           Goal Setting (Chapter 4): Setting clear, achievable goals is critical to success. 
           For example, my goal of working at Microsoft can be broken down into smaller steps, like improving my programming skills and networking with professionals in the field. 
           By making these goals specific and measurable, I can track my progress and stay motivated.
        </p>
        <p>Time Management (Chapter 5): Managing my time effectively is essential for balancing studies, skill development, and personal life. 
           By prioritizing important tasks like practicing coding or working on projects, I can make better use of my time and avoid distractions.
        </p>
        <p>Surrounding Myself with the Right People (Chapter 6): To grow, I need to be around people who inspire me. 
           Seeking out mentors, connecting with other aspiring engineers, and joining tech communities will help me stay motivated and learn from those who have already achieved success.
        </p>
        <p>Lifelong Learning (Chapter 7): The tech industry evolves rapidly, so continuous learning is vital. 
            I should commit to expanding my knowledge in areas like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. 
            By keeping up with new trends and technologies, I’ll stay competitive and adaptable in the field.
            Incorporating these principles will help me not only in my journey toward a career at Microsoft but also in achieving personal growth and long-term success.

        <h3>Degree and Skills</h3>
        <p>The degree I'm currently pursuing is Bachelor of Science in Computing at the University of Technology, Jamaica. The top two skills I have acquired, I'll say, are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Problem-Solving </li>
            <li>Team Collaboration</li>
        </ol>
